# Book Mates

Simple Vite + React frontend for a campus book marketplace (hackathon-ready, frontend-only).

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Project structure

- src/components: shared UI components
- src/pages: route pages
- src/data/books.js: dummy book data

Notes
- No backend required. Forms use mock alerts and in-memory previews.
- Copilot comments are included for future improvements.
